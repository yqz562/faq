# How to scan the barcode on a US Driver's License and get the first name, last name, DOB, etc.?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

You can scan a US driver's license to get all of these details using our SDK. The best way to do so is to follow our pre-built driver license sample for the JavaScript edition, which can be found in the [code gallery](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-javascript-demo). This sample can also be found in the `samples\4.use-case` folder of the JavaScript package download (via the Dynamsoft [free trial download](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/downloads)).
