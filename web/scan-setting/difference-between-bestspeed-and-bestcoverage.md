# What are the differences between the 'speed', 'coverage', 'balance, and 'single' runtime templates?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

`SpeedFirst`, as the name suggests, prioritizes time cost over the accuracy of the results, and `ReadRateFirst` is vice versa.

`Balance` is the perfect middle ground between `SpeedFirst` and `ReadRateFirst`. 

Lastly, the `Single` template is optimized for interactive video scenarios, and is the default mode.

To choose the proper template that you want the SDK to utilize and learn about some of the other templates we offer, please use the [PresetTemplate](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/web/programming/javascript/api-reference/capture-vision-router/preset-templates.html?product=dbr&lang=javascript).

In terms of the individual settings, if you would like to learn of the exact breakdown between the different templates, please contact the [Dynamsoft support team](https://www.dynamsoft.com/contact/).
